After all that Capybara’s been through, he thought he could finally catch a break and enjoy some sugar cane, alongside his dear friend, Spot. His peaceful vacation is disturbed by a mad elephant, called Erp, who tries to modify the sugar cane so that it will make all the people who eat it become his subjects. Capybara and Spot now have a mission, and that is to try and find Erp and teach him a lesson before it’s too late for all the sugar cane lovers.
